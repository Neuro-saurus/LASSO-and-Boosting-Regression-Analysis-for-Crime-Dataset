# Comprehensive Analysis of Communities and Crime Data Using Machine Learning

### Overview of the Dataset

The Communities and Crime dataset, also sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, consists of various features reflecting community attributes and crime statistics. For this analysis, the first 1495 rows were used as a training set, with the remainder serving as a test set.

### Analytical Techniques and Findings

- **Data Preparation**: After addressing missing values through data imputation and disregarding nonpredictive features, the dataset was ready for analysis.
- **Feature Analysis**:
  - A correlation matrix for the dataset features was plotted to identify relationships.
  - The Coefficient of Variation (CV) was calculated for each feature to assess variability relative to the mean.
  - The top features with the highest CV were visually analyzed through scatter plots and box plots, offering insights into their significance.
- **Model Fitting and Evaluation**:
  - **Linear Models**: A linear model using least squares was fitted to the training data, and its performance was evaluated on the test set.
  - **Ridge Regression**: Applied with λ chosen via cross-validation, highlighting the impact of regularization on model complexity and test error.
  - **LASSO**: Both unstandardized and standardized features were used to fit LASSO models, allowing for feature selection and comparison of test errors.
  - **PCR**: A Principal Component Regression model was constructed, optimizing the number of components through cross-validation.
  - **Boosting**: Employing L1-penalized gradient boosting trees (using XGBoost), the model was optimized to determine the regularization term α via cross-validation.

### Conclusions

The comprehensive analyses of both the Acute Inflammations and Communities and Crime datasets demonstrate the applicability of machine learning techniques across different domains, from medical diagnostics to crime data analysis. Through interpretative models like decision trees and advanced regression techniques, significant predictors were identified, contributing to the development of predictive models with practical implications in healthcare diagnostics and community safety.
